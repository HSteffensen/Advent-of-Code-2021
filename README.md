# Advent of Code 2021 Svelte

I was hoping to be weird this year and use Svelte+TypeScript to solve AoC,
but my lack of frontend skills and issues with hosting on GitHub Pages are making it not feasible.

It's the 3rd day and I still haven't properly begun on day 1 still, so I think it's time to move on
and use this year's AoC to get some Kotlin going.
